## Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The first player to line up three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

This repository includes:
- Complete C++ source code for the game.
- CMake configuration files for building the project.
- An AI opponent powered by the **minimax algorithm**.

## Features

- **Minimax AI:** The AI uses the minimax algorithm to choose optimal moves.
- **Multiple Game Modes:** Choose between Human vs Human, Human vs AI, or AI vs AI.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Play directly from your terminal.
- **Win Detection:** Automatically checks for wins, losses, and draws.
- **Clean Code:** Well-commented code thatâ€™s ideal for beginners and those interested in AI.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) installed on your system.

### Build Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdelrahmanElshahat/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
   cd Tic-Tac-Toe
2. **Build the Project**

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .

## Usage
After building the project, you can run the game from the terminal. The game supports three modes:

1. **Human vs Human:** Both players are controlled by humans who input moves via the terminal.
2. **Human vs AI:** Choose whether you want to be the first or second player. The AI will calculate its moves using the minimax algorithm.
3. **AI vs AI:** Observe two AI instances competing, showcasing the minimax algorithm in action.
